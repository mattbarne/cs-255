## Overview of the project
The project was focused around a fictional client called DriverPass, the system was aimed at creating a drivers education course that could be accessed from multiple devices on the web.

## What I did well with this project
I think my charts were done well enough where breaking down the system requirements visually would've been a breeze. I also followed all needed requirements, such as the system scaling based on users, and the data from client to server being secure.

## Areas I can improve
I do like my Gantt chart but I feel its a bit convoluted and could use some edge cases with the added illustrations. I did not account for any time lost in this chart, nor did I expect there to be any since this is a hypothetical scenario.

## User design
The program is overall based of the users experince in the first place, allowing them to track, register, and modify appointments is all tailored for the user. Making the system easy to use and ensuring a high performace make the system that much more of an experience for the user.

## Design strategies
I previously learned about iterative design in another CS class and I believe this is the best way to design a system; this allows you to gather feedback while still continuing with the processes set in place. As for documentation, all the charts and diagrams we made in this class are a huge help especially as the system gets bigger.
